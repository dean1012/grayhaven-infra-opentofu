# Workspaces

Grayhaven Systems LLC infrastructure uses OpenTofu workspaces to separate
shared baseline resources from environment-specific runtime infrastructure.

## Table of Contents

- [Staging](#staging)
- [Production](#production)

## Supported Workspaces

The supported workspaces are:

- `baseline`
- `staging`
- `prod`

## Baseline

The `baseline` workspace manages shared resources that staging and production
depend on, including:

- the DigitalOcean project;
- admin SSH keys;
- DNS zones;
- mail DNS records;
- CAA records;
- the default baseline VPC.

The default baseline VPC is named `grayhaven-core-baseline-vpc` and is not
used. Resources should not be assigned to this VPC. It exists because
DigitalOcean does not allow default VPCs to be destroyed and to act as a safety
net in case a resource is created on accident without explicit VPC assignment.

Protected baseline resources cannot be destroyed through normal OpenTofu
operations. To be absolutely safe, you should not attempt to destroy the
`baseline` workspace. Staging and production depend on the shared resources it
manages, and destroying the `baseline` workspace will cause production outages
for mail and HTTPS services.

## Staging

The `staging` workspace manages temporary environment infrastructure used to
validate changes before promotion to production.

Staging owns environment-specific resources such as:

- the staging VPC;
- staging bastion and web droplets;
- staging firewall attachments;
- staging web DNS records;
- staging droplet DNS records;
- staging load balancers when the compute policy requires them.

Staging reads `config.yml` and `firewall.yml` from the `staging` Git ref in the
local [`grayhaven-vault`](https://github.com/dean1012/grayhaven-vault)
checkout. The vault checkout does not need to have `staging` checked out, but
the ref must be present locally.

The `staging` workspace is expected to be destroyed after validation unless an
active test requires it to remain online.

## Production

The `prod` workspace manages production runtime infrastructure.

Production owns environment-specific resources such as:

- the production VPC;
- production bastion and web droplets;
- production firewall attachments;
- production web DNS records;
- production droplet DNS records;
- production load balancers when the compute policy requires them.

Production reads `config.yml` and `firewall.yml` from the `main` Git ref in the
local [`grayhaven-vault`](https://github.com/dean1012/grayhaven-vault)
checkout. The vault checkout does not need to have `main` checked out, but the
ref must be present locally.

Changes to the `prod` workspace should follow Grayhaven Systems LLC change
control procedures.

The `prod` workspace should not be destroyed. Destroying the `prod` workspace
will cause production outages.
