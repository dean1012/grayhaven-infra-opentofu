## Development Setup

Install verification dependencies:

```bash
sudo dnf install ShellCheck npm
python3 -m pip install actionlint-py
npm config set prefix "$HOME/.local"
npm install --global markdownlint-cli2
printf '%s\n' "$PATH" | grep -qE "(^|:)$HOME/\\.local/bin(:|$)" || \
  printf '\nexport PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"\n' >> "$HOME/.bashrc"
source "$HOME/.bashrc"
```

## Workflow

1. Create a GitHub issue.
2. Create a feature branch for the issue.
3. Sign all commits and reference the issue number.
4. Validate changes locally.
5. Create a pull request to the `main` branch.
6. Reference or close the issue number in the pull request as appropriate for
   code review and merge.

## Local Validation

Validate formatting and syntax from the repository root:

```bash
tofu fmt -check -recursive
shellcheck scripts/read-vault-config
yamllint .
markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "!.terraform/**"
```

If GitHub Actions are changed, validate with:

```bash
actionlint
```

Run the OpenTofu test suite locally from a temporary state-free copy of this
repository:

```bash
tmpdir="$(mktemp -d /tmp/grayhaven-infra-validate.XXXXXX)"

cleanup() {
  if [ -n "$tmpdir" ] && [ -d "$tmpdir" ]; then
    find "$tmpdir" -type f -delete
    find "$tmpdir" -depth -type d -empty -delete
  fi
}

trap cleanup EXIT

rsync -a \
  --exclude '.git' \
  --exclude '.terraform' \
  --exclude 'terraform.tfstate*' \
  --exclude 'terraform.tfstate.d' \
  --exclude '.state-backups' \
  ./ "$tmpdir"/

cd "$tmpdir"
tofu init -backend=false
tofu validate

export TF_VAR_state_encryption_passphrase_baseline='offline-test-baseline-state-passphrase'
export TF_VAR_state_encryption_passphrase_staging='offline-test-staging-state-passphrase'
export TF_VAR_state_encryption_passphrase_prod='offline-test-prod-state-passphrase'

tofu workspace new baseline
tofu test -filter=tests/baseline.tftest.hcl -no-color

tofu workspace new staging
tofu test -filter=tests/staging.tftest.hcl -no-color

tofu workspace new prod
tofu test -filter=tests/prod.tftest.hcl -no-color
```

The [OpenTofu test suite documentation](docs/opentofu-test-suite.md) details
how the test suite is designed and operates.

The DNS tests include a test-only DNS policy fixture through
`grayhaven_test_dns_policy_path`. Leave that variable unset for operational
deployments.

Before committing changes, also check the current diff for whitespace errors:

```bash
git diff --check
```

## Documentation Guidelines

Keep public documentation factual and operational. This repository demonstrates
how Grayhaven Systems LLC manages its own infrastructure; it is not a generic
deployment template.

Document safety boundaries, workspace assumptions, and non-obvious
implementation decisions. Avoid comments that merely restate straightforward
OpenTofu resources.
